# Disney Smart Contract
This is a Smart Contract based on Disney. Users are able to buy tokens minted by the owner of the SC using the ERC20 protocol.

In form of example, 1 token = 1 eth by default. The owner of the SC is able to change this through a function called setTokenPrice.

## Summary

Users are able to buy ERC20 tokens with their Ethers in order to play some Disney games. 
The owner of the SC can:
- Increase the total supply of tokens
- Create new games
- Cancel games (for example, for maintenance)
- Have the history of the users. In the future, the owner can give benefits to the most loyal users.

If users buys 10 tokens and only spends 5 for example, they can exchange their remaining tokens to Ethers. 


## Dependencies
This SC is using SafeMath and ERC20 protocol libraries.


**Larger documentation coming soon...** __btw, comments on code are explaining very well the functionality of the SC :)__
